[[java_plugin]]
== The Java Plugin

The Java plugin adds Java compilation along with testing and bundling capabilities to a project. It serves as the basis for many of the other JVM language Gradle plugins. You can find a comprehensive introduction and overview to the Java Plugin in the <<building_java_projects>> chapter.

[[sec:java_usage]]
=== Usage

To use the Java plugin, include the following in your build script:

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="useJavaPlugin" dir="java/quickstart" title="Using the Java plugin">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
</sample>
++++


[[sec:java_project_layout]]
=== Project layout

The Java plugin assumes the project layout shown below. None of these directories need to exist or have anything in them. The Java plugin will compile whatever it finds, and handles anything which is missing.

[[javalayout]]
include::javaProjectMainLayout.adoc[]

include::javaProjectTestLayout.adoc[]

include::javaProjectGenericLayout.adoc[]

[[sec:changing_java_project_layout]]
==== Changing the project layout

You configure the project layout by configuring the appropriate source set. This is discussed in more detail in the following sections. Here is a brief example which changes the main Java and resource source directories.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="customJavaSourceLayout" dir="java/customizedLayout" title="Custom Java source layout">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="define-main"/>
</sample>
++++

[[sec:java_source_sets]]
=== Source sets

The plugin adds the following <<sec:java_source_sets,source sets>>:

`main`::
Contains the production source code of the project, which is compiled and assembled into a JAR.

`test`::
Contains your test source code, which is compiled and executed using JUnit or TestNG. These are typically unit tests, but you can include any test in this source set as long as they all share the same compilation and runtime classpaths.

[[sec:source_set_properties]]
==== Source set properties

[[java_source_set_tasks]]
==== SourceSet Tasks

For each source set you add to the project, the Java plugin adds the following tasks:


`compile__SourceSet__Java` — type: api:org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.JavaCompile[]::
_Depends on_: All tasks which contribute to the source set's compilation classpath
+
Compiles the given source set's Java source files using the JDK compiler.

`__sourceSet__Classes` — type: api:org.gradle.api.Task[]::
_Depends on_: `compile__SourceSet__Java`, `process__SourceSet__Resources`
+
Prepares the given source set's classes and resources for packaging and execution. Some plugins may add additional compilation tasks for the source set.

==== Lifecycle Tasks

The Java plugin attaches some of its tasks to the lifecycle tasks defined by the <<sec:base_tasks,Base Plugin>> — which the Java Plugin applies automatically — and it also adds a few other lifecycle tasks:

`assemble`::
_Depends on_: `jar`, and all other tasks that create artifacts attached to the `archives` configuration
+
Aggregate task that assembles all the archives in the project. This task is added by the Base Plugin.

`check`::
_Depends on_: `test`
+
Aggregate task that performs verification tasks, such as running the tests. Some plugins add their own verification tasks to `check`. You should also attach any custom `Test` tasks to this lifecycle task if you want them to execute for a full build. This task is added by the Base Plugin.

`build`::
_Depends on_: `check`, `assemble`
+
Aggregate tasks that performs a full build of the project. This task is added by the Base Plugin.

It supports the core Javadoc options and the options of the standard doclet described in the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html[reference documentation] of the Javadoc executable. For a complete list of supported Javadoc options consult the API documentation of the following classes: api:org.gradle.external.javadoc.CoreJavadocOptions[] and api:org.gradle.external.javadoc.StandardJavadocDocletOptions[].

==== ProcessResources properties

`Object srcDirs`::
Default value: `__sourceSet__.resources`. Can set using anything described in <<sec:specifying_multiple_files>>.

`File destinationDir`::
Default value: `__sourceSet__.output.resourcesDir`. Can set using anything described in <<sec:locating_files>>.


[[sec:compile]]
=== CompileJava

The Java plugin adds a api:org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.JavaCompile[] instance for each source set in the project. Some of the most common configuration options are shown below.

==== Compile properties

`api:org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection[] classpath`::
Default value: `__sourceSet__.compileClasspath`

`api:org.gradle.api.file.FileTree[] source`::
Default value: `__sourceSet__.java`. Can set using anything described in <<sec:specifying_multiple_files>>.

`File destinationDir`::
Default value: `__sourceSet__.java.outputDir`

By default, the Java compiler runs in the Gradle process. Setting `options.fork` to `true` causes compilation to occur in a separate process. In the case of the Ant javac task, this means that a new process will be forked for each compile task, which can slow down compilation. Conversely, Gradle's direct compiler integration (see above) will reuse the same compiler process as much as possible. In both cases, all fork options specified with `options.forkOptions` will be honored.

[[sec:incremental_compile]]
==== Incremental Java compilation

Gradle comes with a sophisticated incremental Java compiler that is active by default.

This gives you the following benefits

* Incremental builds are much faster.
* The smallest possible number of class files are changed.
  Classes that don't need to be recompiled remain unchanged in the output directory.
  An example scenario when this is really useful is using JRebel - the fewer output classes are changed the quicker the JVM can use refreshed classes.

To help you understand how incremental compilation works, the following provides a high-level overview:

* Gradle will recompile all classes _affected_ by a change.
* A class is _affected_ if it has been changed or if it depends on another affected class.
    This works no matter if the other class is defined in the same project, another project or even an external library.
* A class's dependencies are determined from type references in its bytecode.
* Since constants can be inlined, any change to a constant will result in Gradle recompiling all source files.
    For that reason, you should try to minimize the use of constants in your source code and replace them with static methods where possible.
* Since source-retention annotations are not visible in bytecode, changes to a source-retention annotation will result in full recompilation.
* You can improve incremental compilation performance by applying good software desing principles like loose coupling.
    For instance, if you put an interface between a concrete class and its dependents, the dependent classes are only recompiled when the interface changes, but not when the implementation changes.
* The class analysis is cached in the project directory, so the first build after a clean checkout can be slower. Consider turning off the incremental compiler on your build server.

[[sec:incremental_compilation_known_issues]]
===== Known issues

* If a compile task fails due to a compile error, it will do a full compilation again the next time it is invoked.

[[sec:incremental_annotation_processing]]
==== Incremental annotation processing

Starting with Gradle 4.7, the incremental compiler also supports incremental annotation processing.
Annotation processors need to opt in to this feature, otherwise they will trigger a full recompilation.

As a user you can see which annotation processors are triggering full recompilations in the `--info` log.
Incremental annotation processing will be deactivated if a custom `executable` or `javaHome` is configured on the compile task.

===== Making an annotation processor incremental

Please first have a look at <<sec:incremental_compile>>, as incremental annotation processing builds on top of it.

Gradle supports incremental compilation for two common categories of annotation processors: "isolating" and "aggregating".
Please consult the information below to decide which category fits your processor.

You can then register your processor for incremental compilation using a file in the processor's META-INF directory.
The format is one line per processor, with the fully qualified name of the processor class and its category separated by a comma.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="incrementalAnnotationProcessorRegistration" dir="java/incrementalAnnotationProcessing" title="Registering incremental annotation processors">
     <sourcefile file="processor/src/main/resources/META-INF/gradle/incremental.annotation.processors" snippet="registering-incremental-annotation-processors"/>
</sample>
++++


If your processor can only decide at runtime whether it is incremental or not, you can declare it as "dynamic" in the META-INF descriptor
and return its true type at runtime using the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html#getSupportedOptions()[Processor#getSupportedOptions()] method.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="dynamicAnnotationProcessorRegistration" dir="java/incrementalAnnotationProcessing" title="Registering incremental annotation processors dynamically">
     <sourcefile file="processor/src/main/java/ServiceRegistryProcessor.java" snippet="options-of-dynamic-processor"/>
</sample>
++++

Both categories have the following limitations:

* They must generate their files using the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Filer.html[Filer API].
    Writing files any other way will result in silent failures later on, as these files won't be cleaned up correctly.
    If your processor does this, it cannot be incremental.
* They must not depend on compiler-specific APIs like https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/com/sun/source/util/Trees.html[com.sun.source.util.Trees].
    Gradle wraps the processing APIs, so attempts to cast to compiler-specific types will fail.
    If your processor does this, it cannot be incremental, unless you have some fallback mechanism.
* If they use https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Filer.html#getResource(javax.tools.JavaFileManager.Location,java.lang.CharSequence,java.lang.CharSequence)[Filer#getResource], Gradle will recompile all source files.
    See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/4701[gradle/issues/4701]
* If they use https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Filer.html#createResource(javax.tools.JavaFileManager.Location,java.lang.CharSequence,java.lang.CharSequence,javax.lang.model.element.Element...)[Filer#createResource], Gradle will recompile all source files.
    See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/4702[gradle/issues/4702]

====== "Isolating" annotation processors

The fastest category, these look at each annotated element in isolation, creating generated files or validation messages for it.
For instance an `EntityProcessor` could create a `<TypeName>Repository` for each type annotated  with `@Entity`.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="isolatingAnnotationProcessor" dir="java/incrementalAnnotationProcessing" title="An isolated annotation processor">
     <sourcefile file="processor/src/main/java/EntityProcessor.java" snippet="isolating-annotation-processor"/>
</sample>
++++

"Isolating" processors have the following limitations:

* They must make all decisions (code generation, validation messages) for an annotated type based on information reachable from its AST.
    This means you can analyze the types' super-class, method return types, annotations etc., even transitively.
    But you cannot make decisions based on unrelated elements in the RoundEnvironment.
    Doing so will result in silent failures because too few files will be recompiled later.
    If your processor needs to make decisions based on a combination of otherwise unrelated elements, mark it as "aggregating" instead.
* They must provide exactly one originating element for each file generated with the `Filer` API.
    If zero or many originating elements are provided, Gradle will recompile all source files.


When a source file is recompiled, Gradle will recompile all files generated from it.
When a source file is deleted, the files generated from it are deleted.

====== "Aggregating" annotation processors

These can aggregate several source files into one ore more output files or validation messages.
For instance, a `ServiceRegistryProcessor` could create a single `ServiceRegistry` with one method for each type annotated with `@Service`

"Aggregating" processors have the following limitations:

* They can only read `CLASS` or `RUNTIME` retention annotations
* They can only read parameter names if the user passes the `-parameters` compiler argument.

Gradle will always reprocess (but not recompile) all annotated files that the processor was registered for.
Gradle will always recompile any files the processor generates.

[[sec:java_compile_avoidance]]
==== Compile avoidance

If a dependent project has changed in an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface[ABI]-compatible way (only its private API has changed), then Java compilation tasks will be up-to-date. This means that if project `A` depends on project `B` and a class in `B` is changed in an ABI-compatible way (typically, changing only the body of a method), then Gradle won't recompile `A`.

Some of the types of changes that do not affect the public API and are ignored:

* Changing a method body
* Changing a comment
* Adding, removing or changing private methods, fields, or inner classes
* Adding, removing or changing a resource
* Changing the name of jars or directories in the classpath
* Renaming a parameter


Compile-avoidance is deactivated if annotation processors are found on the compile classpath, because for annotation processors the implementation details matter. Annotation processors should be declared on the annotation processor path instead. Gradle 5.0 will ignore processors on the compile classpath.

[[sec:java_test]]
=== Test

The `test` task is an instance of api:org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test[]. It automatically detects and executes all unit tests in the `test` source set. It also generates a report once test execution is complete. JUnit and TestNG are both supported. Have a look at api:org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test[] for the complete API.

See the _<<java_testing,Testing in Java & JVM projects>>_ chapter for more details.


[[sec:jar]]
=== Jar

The `jar` task creates a JAR file containing the class files and resources of the project. The JAR file is declared as an artifact in the `archives` dependency configuration. This means that the JAR is available in the classpath of a dependent project. If you upload your project into a repository, this JAR is declared as part of the dependency descriptor. You can learn more about how to work with archives in <<sec:archives>> and artifact configurations in <<artifact_management>>.


[[sub:manifest]]
==== Manifest

Each jar or war object has a `manifest` property with a separate instance of api:org.gradle.api.java.archives.Manifest[]. When the archive is generated, a corresponding `MANIFEST.MF` file is written into the archive.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="manifest" dir="userguide/tutorial/manifest" title="Customization of MANIFEST.MF">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="add-to-manifest"/>
</sample>
++++

You can create stand-alone instances of a `Manifest`. You can use that for example, to share manifest information between jars.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="manifest" dir="userguide/tutorial/manifest" title="Creating a manifest object.">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="custom-manifest"/>
</sample>
++++

You can merge other manifests into any `Manifest` object. The other manifests might be either described by a file path or, like in the example above, by a reference to another `Manifest` object.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="manifest" dir="userguide/tutorial/manifest" title="Separate MANIFEST.MF for a particular archive">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="merge"/>
</sample>
++++

Manifests are merged in the order they are declared by the `from` statement. If the base manifest and the merged manifest both define values for the same key, the merged manifest wins by default. You can fully customize the merge behavior by adding `eachEntry` actions in which you have access to a api:org.gradle.api.java.archives.ManifestMergeDetails[] instance for each entry of the resulting manifest. The merge is not immediately triggered by the from statement. It is done lazily, either when generating the jar, or by calling `writeTo` or `effectiveManifest`

You can easily write a manifest to disk.
